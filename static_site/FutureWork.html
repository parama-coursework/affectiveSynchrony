    <p>1. Interactive visualization of EDA's would allow for a more dynamic method of viewing the data, allowing for another visual dimension (movement) to potentially enhance understanding or yield more visually clear results. </p>
    <p>2. The data set in this case was very small, and as such, we cannot draw many conclusions in terms of what reliable signs of synchrony might look like in a larger pool of people. It could be beneficial and interesting to conduct a larger experiment involving a bigger pool of people in order to see whether better data could be found. Also, there is much scope to measure synchrony with EDA in many other contexts beyond that of a treatment provider and a patient. Even within that context, there is a lot of scope for asking more questions. In this case for example, the children saw these occupational therapists relatively often and they were familiar to them. Also, the sessions very rather long. One could measure interactions between people and vary how intimate they are, as well as how long they are interacting for. <!-- end .content --></p>
