    <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
    <p>It should be noted that this work builds on Elliot Hedman's work, &quot;Wireless, In-Situ Measurement of Electrodermal Activity During Occupational Therapy.&quot; His other work, further discussing In-Situ Measurement of Occupational Therapy gives significant context to the data that was explored here. </p>
    <h2>ELECTRODERMAL ACTIVITY AS A MEASURE OF AROUSAL</h2>
    <p>Electrodermal Activity is a measure of arousal that correlates with changes in skin conductance. Positive EDA activity correlates with increased amount of sweat produced by the eccrine sweat glands. This in turn means that EDA correlates with sympathetic nervous system arousal, which is activated by many neural affective responses. It is used under these premises as an indicator of affective arousal changes. EDA readings are also moderated by other physiological factors such as temperature or level of physical exertion, and so it is important to take contextual factors into account when interpreting readings. </p>
    <h2>DEFINING &quot;AFFECTIVE SYNCHRONY&quot;</h2>
    <p>For the purposes of this study, affective synchrony describes the phenomenon of  a clear relationship between two EDA readings that reflects physiological responses that approach one another in frequency over time as the two people engage socially with one another. </p>
    <h2>PREVIOUS WORK MEASURING AFFECTIVE SYNCHRONY</h2>
    <p><!-- end .content -->Previous work measuring affective synchrony in the context of electrodermal activity as pertinent to this work has primarily been done with mothers and infants. We can look at results from this work to gain a better understanding of how EDA can be used to examine the relationship between a caregiver and a child. In terms of the aim of this project, we hope to learn more about response patterns of the occupational therapists when interacting with the children, and hopefully, use this information to positively influence their care. </p>
    <h2>VISUALIZATION AS A TOOL FOR INVESTIGATION</h2>
    <p>Visualization is a valuable tool, but it is particularly suited to interpretation of highly abundant and complex data. In today's day and age, and particularly in the case of affective data sets, the demands placed cognitively on a reader in terms of how many dimensions their data has, as well as its sheer quantity have increased considerably as our ability to collect data at higher time resolutions improves. <br />
      <br />
     The brain is limited in how much information it can hold in working memory at a given point, but when we seek to understand or analyze any type of numerical information, it is our working memory that we put cognitive load on (Bear). Visualization allows an experimenter to process a significant amount of information in a much shorter period of time because it allows for information communication along many more dimensions as compared to written communication (Heer). When effectively executed, it takes advantage of the brain's inherent biases towards pattern recognition in the visual system in order to communicate information far more rapidly than one can with speech. Certainly, connections must ultimately be made back to a small set of quantitative conclusions, but in terms of gaining a general understanding or exploring a data set, for initial pattern detection, as well as clarity in how information is communicated to a researcher, exploration of untraditional visualization methods could greatly enhance understanding of a data set. </p>
