    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>When studying affect, we note that it is one of the core aspects of the human experience. Affect can change our perception of current events, past events, and help us make difficult choices, shaping our actions, and thus future events. Evolutionary psychologists posit that affect is central to enabling social behavior. As such, when examining affective data, it seems natural that we would want to be able to compare affective data readings from people who are interacting with one another, and that we might want to study whether they influence each other's affect. </p>
    <p>Intuitively, based on our personal experience, we know that the answer to this question is most likely yes, that people do influence eachother's affect, but there are many questions that stem from this one that do not have such obvious answers: does EDA data reflect these changes in affect? Can we measure the changes in affect evoked by an interaction between two people? Can we measure how emotionally &quot;in sync&quot; people are with one another? How would we define this &quot;synchrony&quot;?</p>
    <p>When analyzing affective data, we are confronted with numerous challenges due to how many different factors mediate affect. Particularly with EDA data, there is frequent noise, and both emotional and physiological factors can change a reading. EDA data can also be very dense, and plentiful. </p>
    <p>When faced with an abundance of data, we often must turn to more novel methods of analysis in order to gain a better understanding. As such, this project aims to use data visualization techniques in order to investigate whether synchrony can be made apparent in EDA data. </p>
    <p>In the case of this particular project, we chose to analyze a dataset that measured EDA levels for a set of occupational therapists and children with Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) during 50 minute long therapy sessions. </p>
    <p>It is our hope that investigation of affective synchrony between treatment providers and their patients could yield a deeper understanding of what factors make patients more responsive to their providers, allowing for better future care. </p>
