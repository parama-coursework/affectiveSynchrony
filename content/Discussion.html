				    <h1>DISCUSSION</h1>
				    <p>Based on our current results we found that local trends did not seem to consistently reflect short periods of engagement. We did find, however, that longer periods of engagement yielded increased correlation relatively consistently. One example of this can be found in the subject 10 sample set where, for the second half of the time series the child and the therapist are engaged in playing with some sand while facing each other and conversing with each other for an extended period of time. During this portion of the sample set the cumulative correlation of the filtered data samples rises gradually and consistently the longer the occupational therapist and child are playing. The most helpful and visually striking method of seeing results in regards to engagement was found to be the cumulative correlation measures, as the moving window correlation seemed to fluctuate very frequently over small timespans, but trends could be found for longer time segments in the cumulative correlation time series. Peak frequency occasionally was also evident during periods of time when the therapist was watching or conversing the child, as takes place in the beginning of subject 14's first few minutes of data, or at the beginning of subject 4's data set when there is a cluster of peaks for the therapist and child while the therapist speak to the child about climbing into a hammock and watches them climb into the hammock. </p><p>  Another interesting aspect we observed is that sometimes the child and occupational therapist didn’t necessarily seem to be engaging verbally or even looking at one another, however correlation in EDA seems to rise when the therapist spends an extended period of time observing the child during a session without verbally engaging with anybody else. One example of this can be found in subject 14’s data set, during the beginning third of the sample, when the child did not seem to be engaging in any way with the therapist, but the therapist was concentrating visually on the child. The vast majority of times however, a rise in cumulative correlation is observed when the child is, in fact, speaking to the therapist or listening to the therapist speak to them. Subject 4's data set is also consistent with this, with constant engagement being evident throughout the interaction and providing support to the notion that consistent observation or verbal interaction would both be ways to encourage synchrony in EDA readings. During this data set, the child is occasionally being watched by the therapist, but is not necessarily constantly speaking to the therapist, yet cumulative correlation increases as the session goes on.</p>

				    <p>A notable and particularly interesting sample set is session 1, for subject 13, in which the therapist accidentally exposes the child to a toy that the child is afraid of. During this time period, the therapist makes a joke about the toy but the child is clearly fearful, going so far as to reengage with the therapist in order to request that the therapist not expose the child to the toy again. During this set of events, one would expect almost no synchrony between the therapist and the child since it is clear that the therapist is not emotionally engaging with the child in the sense that the therapist is not empathizing with the child's fear. The results do indeed show a drop in correlation between the two data samples for the child and the therapist during this period of time. </p><p>Overall, a much larger data set would be required in order to fully investigate whether or not synchrony occurs between subjects that are engaged. This preliminary sample set of data seems to only demonstrate synchrony when the child and therapist were observing one another and not interacting with anybody else, or engaged in a common activity for a few minutes at a time with very minimal if any disengagement that might span a few seconds. Nonetheless, these results are both interesting and compelling enough that further investigation may not be unwarranted. </p>
