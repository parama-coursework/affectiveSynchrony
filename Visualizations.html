    <h1>VISUALIZATIONS</h1>
    <p>Below, you will find links to interactive visualizations that display data pertinent to the investigations conducted. Directions are organized by Investigation. All visualizations were constructed using the javascript library D3 created by the Stanford Visualization Group. The data that they call are in JSON format. </p>
    <h2>SESSION PLOTS</h2>
    <p>For each session plot, you will see a plot of filtered and normalized EDA's of the child and occupational therapist on the bottom of the screen over the course of a session. To select a subset of time during the session, click and drag over the range in question. A grey square will highlight the range you are choosing. When you have selected the subset of time in question, release the mouse, and the plots in the rest of the screen will update to display the normalized, unfiltered EDA's of the child and occupational therapist in question, with the filtered versions stacked on top of them in the same plot. Hit buttons near the plot if you would like to view only filtered or unfiltered data, or if you would like to see where detected peaks are. Other plots will indicate a moving average of delay between peaks, correlation between filtered data, and average number of peaks during the selected subset of time.    </p>
    <h2>ENGAGED VS UNENGAGED PLOT</h2>
    <p>This plot is an abbreviated view displaying data over subselected periods of time during a session allowing the user to view the difference between when the occupational therapist was engaged vs unengaged.    </p>
    <h2>DATA CONVERSION</h2>
    <p>I recieved the initial dataset in excel format. I used a python script written by Peter Combs (pcombs@gmail.com) to convert my excel files into .mat files, and another matlab script, found here, to convert my matlab data into the JSON files that are read by D3.    <!-- end .content --></p>
